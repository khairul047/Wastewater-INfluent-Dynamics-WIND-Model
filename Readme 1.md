### DATA ABSTRACT:

The Tile and Rotation Enhanced Cropland (TREC) dataset provides a high-resolution (30 m) spatial representation of land use in the Conterminous United States (CONUS), specifically designed to improve hydrological modeling in agricultural systems by enhanced spatial accuracy. This dataset consists of a single-band tiff image (`Tile_Rotation_Enhanced_CDL2017.tif`) with values ranging from 1 to 1522, representing various land use classes and tile drainage conditions as mapped in the csv file (`TREC_Datset_Code_Names.csv`). This dataset contains spatially explicit (pixel-wise) data on croplands, categorized by tile drainage status (tiled vs. non-tiled) and cropping system (continuous vs. discontinuous rotation). The TREC dataset is built upon the 2017 Cropland Data Layer (CDL); therefore, the values for non-tiled and discontinuous croplands in the TREC dataset developed in this study align with those in the 2017 CDL. This forms the basis for naming the output file as `Tile_Rotation_Enhanced_CDL2017.tif` (TREC2017). The TREC dataset supports reliable hydrologic modeling, enabling informed decision-making for watershed conservation, nutrient management, and agricultural policy development. This dataset is a vital resource for researchers and policymakers focused on sustainable agricultural practices and water resource management.

## METHODS AND MATERIALS

### DATA PROCESSING METHODS 

The TREC dataset was generated using a geospatial methodology implemented through a custom JavaScript script (`TREC2017_20250519.js`) in Google Earth Engine (GEE). This dataset integrates information from the 2017 Crop Data Layer (CDL) (USDA NASS 2017), 2024 crop frequency data covering the years 2008 to 2024 (USDA NASS 2024), and tile drainage data from Ag-Tile US 2017 developed by [Valayamkunnath et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-00596-x). The image generated in GEE is exported as a single-band GeoTIFF file (`Tile_Rotation_Enhanced_CDL2017.tif`) with Unsigned 16-bit integer (**Uint16**) pixel values ranging from 1 to 1522, representing various land use classes and tile drainage conditions. The dataset is accompanied by a CSV file (`TREC_Datset_Code_Names.csv`) that maps each unique pixel values to their corresponding land use class and tile drainage condition.

The performance of the TREC dataset against traditional CDL dataset was validated using its application in eco-hydrologic modeling of two watersheds: Boone and Minnesota in the state of the art Soil and Water Assessment Tool (**SWAT+**) (Bieger et al., 2017a). The dataset performance was evaluated by comparing the tile drainage area in Landscape Units (LSUs) while the simulated hydrologic response of SWAT+ model is compared against observed streamflow data at various USGS measuring stations as in `Flow_cms.csv` files present in respective watershed folders. Additionally, SWAT+ split landuse option does not physically split the HRUs and hence, the python model in `HRU_Split` folder is used to split the HRUs based on the percentage of landuse in each HRU and visualize the tile drainage flow from each split HRU as saved in the shapefiles (`SWAT+ Model Folders\Outputs\HRU2_Split_Recursive_qtile.shp`). The TREC dataset was found to be more spatially accurate against randomized or averaged tile drainage area estimates applied on CDL dataset in the SWAT+ model, and it improved the hydrologic response of the model compared to the traditional CDL dataset.

### Steps to Generate TREC Dataset:
**Step1:** Upload the input data files to GEE assets. <br>
**Step2:** Open the GEE Code Editor and paste the script `TREC2017_20250519.js` into the editor.<br>
**Step3:** Edit the script to the requirements of your analysis.<br>
- Replace the asset paths in the script with your uploaded files <br>
- Select the appropriate region of interest (ROI) for processing if needed or leave it as is for the entire CONUS region.<br>
- Change the thresholds for continuous crop frequency if required. <br>
- Select the appropriate output file name and export parameters in the script.<br>

**Step4:** Run the script to generate the TREC dataset.<br>
**Step5:** Append the attributes table of the resulting TREC dataset to the `TREC_Datset_Code_Names.csv` file to map pixel values to land use classes and tile drainage conditions.

### **NOTE:** GEE Tile Error - Image Size Exceeds Limit

When attempting to visualize the `Tiledrain_rotation_separated_CDL2017` image in **Google Earth Engine (GEE)**, you may encounter the following errors:

> Tile error: Number of pixels requested from Image.reproject exceeds the maximum allowed (2^31).
Tile error: Reprojection output too large (49397x37735 pixels).


These errors occur because the **ROI** is too large. The free version of GEE has a processing limit of **2³¹ pixels** for reprojection and visualization. When exceeded, GEE fails to render the image tiles.

### Recommended Solution

To avoid these errors:

1. **Use a smaller ROI** during processing to reduce pixel count.
2. **Comment out the visualization line** to avoid interactive rendering:

   ```javascript
   //Map.addLayer(Tiledrain_rotation_separated_CDL2017, visParamsFinalClipped, "Tiledrain_rotation_separated_CDL2017");
   ```
3. Export the image to Google Drive and open it in a desktop GIS platform such as: ArcGIS Pro and QGIS.
